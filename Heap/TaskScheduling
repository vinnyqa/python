# You are given an array of CPU tasks, where tasks[i] is an uppercase english character from A to Z. You are also given an integer n.
# Each CPU cycle allows the completion of a single task, and tasks may be completed in any order.
# The only constraint is that identical tasks must be separated by at least n CPU cycles, to cooldown the CPU.
# Return the minimum number of CPU cycles required to complete all tasks.
# GREEDY APPROACH
